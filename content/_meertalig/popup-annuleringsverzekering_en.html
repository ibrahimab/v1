Via us, It is possible to effect one of the two below mentioned cancellation insurances of Europeesche Verzekeringen.</p>
<p><b>Standard cancellation insurance</b><br>
With the standard Europeesche cancellation insurance you are well-insured in case you have to cancel your trip. Besides insurance for the costs you have due to cancelling, your unused travel days will be insured as well. The premium is 5.5% of the total travel sum (+ 21% insurance tax = 6.65%).
</p>

<p><b>All-risk cancellation insurance</b><br>
When you take out an all-risk cancellation insurance, besides being covered for the reasons listed in the terms and conditions, you may also determine your own reason why you are not able to go on vacation.</p>
<p>For example, you will be covered if your best friend falls seriously ill, or if you get that that new job or assignment and have to start soon. For these self-determined reasons you will get 75% of your cancellation costs reimbursed. Please consult the terms and conditions for the exceptions on this rule. The premium is 7.0% of the total travel sum (+ 21% insurance tax = 8.45%).</p>
