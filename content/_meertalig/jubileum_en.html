<b>A party at Chalet.nl! We turned 10 years old, and therefore you deserve a treat. If you make a reservation in the period up to 10 October you will receive a cake, delivered right on your doormat.</b><p>
<b>The hobby that got out of control</b><br>
What started in 1999 as a hobby that got out of control, has now grown to a fully fledged travel company. Today Chalet.nl is specialized in the rental of chalets and apartments from 2 to 44 persons, particularly in France, Austria and Switzerland.
<p>
In the summer season you can also book via us. Soon we will launch a specialized website for this: Zomerhuisje.nl.<p>
<b>Search &amp; Book</b><br>
We would love to help you with your search for a good accommodation. To make this even easier, we have made some changes to the website. You will now find the search & book function on our homepage and the descriptions and pictures of the accommodations have received a better spot.<p>
<b>Inspiration</b><br>
You're not yet sure what sort of accommodation you want? Be inspired by our themes and accommodation tips. We will refresh these on a regular basis. If you have specific wishes, please let us know, and we will find a few fitting accommodations for you. You can reach us by phone, but of course you can also send us an email.
<p>
We wish you a lot of fun with your holiday anticipation!
<p>
The team of Chalet.nl
