<h2>The keyword is specialization</h2>
Chalet.nl doesn't go for the mass tourism. Specialization is what we choose for. Winter sports enthusiasts can come to us for a winter holiday in a chalet or a luxurious apartment in one of the Alpine countries. If desired we can include ski passes, ski equipment catering and other options. Our sales team has an extensive knowledge of the various destinations in our programme. This holds also true for the accommodations. We strive to visit every accommodation personally.
<p>
<h2>High quality of service</h2>
Our quality of service has a very high priority. If you give us your wishes, we will find you several accommodations that will fit these wishes. Is that one accommodation you adore already booked? Then we will offer you similar accommodations. Do you want to make changes in your booking? We will make those changes free of charge up to at least six weeks before your departure.
